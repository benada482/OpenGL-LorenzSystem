# Lorenz System Simulation:

#Intro:
This software uses particles to simulate a Lorenz System. It spawns a certain amount of particles that will then follow the differetial equations to update their positions. 
These equations were created by Edward Lorenz to show a simplified model of atmospheric convection.

#Profile:

#Plan:
In worksheet 2 I have successfully create a way to render and display 2D particles within the window. Since this runs quite well as evidenced by the profiling I will be transitioning to 3D to add an extra layer of complexity.
In worksheet 3 the model will be rendered in 3 dimensions with the differential equations put in place so that the Lorenz System will be working modelling the particles moving between the attractors.
The plan for worksheet 4 is to add user engagement so that there is a way to interact with the overall model. There is also a plan to review the profiling completed within worksheet 3 and improve and optimise the program to fix any issues that can be found.
